### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building:
  - A Financial App for a client should comply with a regulation requiring encryption. I built it with Django, PostgreSQL, and Redis and hosted it on Bare Metal Server. The target is 5000 concurrent users.
  - A benchmark of web applications that can be run easily on any local machine. So it can become a base benchmark project that is useful for everyone to decide whether to go with it or choose another one.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Golang and Rust
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - My project above
  - I can also hired as a freelancer
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building a product from scratch until it is deployed to production, especially in AWS.
